										<h4>Gold</h4>
										<p>With the current volatility in the stock and bond markets, many investors are
											turning to gold. One reason to invest in gold is because when you add gold
											and other commodities to your investment portfolio, the market’s ups and
											downs can be smoothed out. Because gold’s price has gone down in recent
											months, gold is more affordable than it was a few years ago and many gold
											investors anticipate an upswing in the precious metal’s price.</p>

										<h4>Diamonds</h4>
										<p>For investors seeking additional safe havens for their investments, diamonds
											may be an interesting alternative. Diamonds could offer benefits that are
											simply overlooked by the average investor. Diversifying your investment
											portfolio by adding these asset classes can help to protect your portfolio
											against the downturns we saw in 2008, hedge your investments against global
											uncertainty and inflation, provide returns, as well as provide a certainty
											that no “paper” investment can possibly give you. While these types of
											investments used to be available only to the super-rich, today average
											investors have access to them.</p>

										<h5>Investing in Diamonds could be Right for You</h5>
										<p>There are three key reasons to diversify your portfolio by including assets
											such as diamonds and gold:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>1. Diversification can help to protect your portfolio (your hard-earned
												money) against market corrections. </li>
											<li>2. Try for increased returns. And, </li>
											<li>3. The security of having an investment you can hold in your hands.
											</li>
										</ol>
										<p>If these benefits resonate with you, consider adding diamonds to your
											portfolio. Of course, you should always consult your legal, tax,
											and investment advisors before making any significant decisions,
											but let’s look at each of these three reasons.</p>

										<h5>The Benefits of Investing in Diamonds</h5>
										<h6>&mdash; Diversification</h6>
										<p>For decades, investors have split their portfolios into stocks and bonds.
											That’s
											diversification. Traditionally, when the stock market went down, the bond
											market
											stayed relatively stable, in part because it provided yields in the form of
											bond
											interest, thereby moderating any recession’s effect on the portfolio. As
											much as
											we’d all like to forget 2008, it still serves as an important lesson. As
											investors began to expect more from their fixed-income portfolio, they
											wanted
											their bonds to provide more than just a couple of percent of interest. Then
											came
											the mortgage-backed securities, which were investment grade, and ultimately
											came
											the “sub-prime” mortgage-backed securities. (Think of the book, and now
											movie,
											“The Big Short.”) When those collapsed, countless millions of dollars of
											assets,
											which investors thought were solid, evaporated into thin air. One solution
											to
											protect against that risk is to invest in assets that cannot
											evaporate—investments that you can hold in your hand if you want to be
											reassured
											that they are still there. Perhaps the most basic way is to invest in an
											asset
											that you can hold in your hand—raw diamonds.</p>

										<p>Far from being only used by fine jewelers, and sold mostly around Valentine’s
											Day, industrial diamonds have many uses and demand continues year round.
											They
											are used in cutting and drilling tools, from your local stone mason and
											patio
											installer, who uses diamond-tipped blades to cut the masonry, to industrial
											mining and drilling operations. The ever-expanding high-tech industries use
											diamonds in applications such as in lasers and for semiconductor
											manufacturing.
											More than 80% of diamonds are used in industrial applications, so even if
											the
											economy prevents some people from buying that big engagement ring, computer
											chips will still be manufactured. Thus, diamonds are a great way to
											diversify
											the portfolio.</p>

										<h6>&mdash; Potential for Returns</h6>
										<p>In 2010, rough-cut diamonds provided a return of 20% while the S&P 500 lagged
											behind with just over 12% total return, and that was during a stock market
											recovery. And demand for diamonds continues to
											grow. In addition to the high-quality jewelry-grade diamonds, even
											low-quality
											diamonds have widespread demand in the global economy. A demand that is
											widely
											expected to grow unabated. It’s simple supply and demand, a steady or
											increasing
											demand means that, all other factors being equal, prices will increase.
											Because
											the diamond market benefits from both industrial and luxury purchases, it
											tends
											to thrive across several fronts.</p>

										<h6>&mdash; An Investment you can Hold in your Hand</h6>
										<p>A big question that investors ask their advisors, especially after the
											sub-prime
											mortgage fiasco, is “Where exactly is my money?” Investors are tired of
											investments that are paper, held by someone else, who holds another piece of
											paper that’s held by yet someone else. They want something that they can
											see.
											They want to be able to see and feel the solidity of their investments.</p>

										<p>Imagine this: You are watching the evening news. After the story of yet
											another
											financial fiasco or ponzi scheme and the countless investors devastated by
											the
											news, there is another segment on the stock market’s depressing reaction. Of
											course you will call your investment advisor in the morning, because you
											know
											for a fact that he won’t return your call right now. After making a note in
											your
											calendar, you open your wall safe and pick up a dark velvet pouch. Feel how
											heavy it is, how good it feels in your hands. Open it and pour a few
											diamonds
											into your palm. They are real. They didn’t evaporate or disappear with no
											credible explanation. You know that they will be there as long as you want
											them
											to be. As you go back to the news, the next segments discuss a new
											semiconductor
											plant and the increasing job market in the mining industry. You smile
											because
											you know that diamonds will always be in demand.</p>
